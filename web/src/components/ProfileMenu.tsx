/**
 * The connected wallet menu.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ Everything here is a link, a read, or a disconnect. Nothing in this menu moves money, which is
 * deliberate: a header dropdown is the easiest thing on a page to open by accident, and it opens
 * over whatever somebody was doing. Launching is a form you fill in and a transaction you sign there.
 *
 * ## ⛔⛔ IT MUST WORK WITH EITHER IDENTITY ALONE
 *
 * There are two, and neither implies the other: a WALLET is who you are on chain, and an ACCOUNT on
 * X or GitHub is who you are to a launch that names you as a payee. Somebody can be owed fees on
 * ten launches without ever holding the wallet that made any of them.
 *
 * ⚠ The old version returned a bare Connect button whenever no wallet was attached — so anybody who
 * had signed in with GitHub to collect fees had nowhere to see they were signed in and no way to
 * sign out. That is the exact bug PONSPAD's menu carries a comment about.
