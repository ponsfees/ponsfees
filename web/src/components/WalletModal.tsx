/**
 * The connect dialog.
 *
 * ## ⛔⛔ TWO IDENTITIES, AND THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT OFFERS BOTH AT ONCE
 *
 * A WALLET is who you are on chain. An ACCOUNT on X or GitHub is who you are to a launch that named
 * you as a payee, and neither implies the other — somebody can be owed fees on ten launches without
 * ever holding the wallet that made any of them. This dialog used to offer only wallets, so the one
 * control on the page labelled "Connect" could not do half of what connecting means here, and the
 * account sign-ins were reachable only from a dropdown you have to already be connected to open.
 *
 * ⚠ Headed sections rather than one merged list: they are not interchangeable, and a person opening
 * this knows which of the two they came for.
 *
 * ⚠ Closed by Escape and by a click on the backdrop, and it takes the focus when it opens. A modal
 * that can only be dismissed by finding its own control is a trap, and one that leaves focus behind
 * it is unusable by keyboard.

    header, so "fixed, inset 0" resolved against a 72px tall bar: the overlay covered the header
    only and the dialog was clipped to a sliver at the top of the page. Nothing about the CSS was
