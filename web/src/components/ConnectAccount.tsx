 * settles what "Connect" means before the reader gets to the label — the header menu and the claim
 * panel were otherwise two different-looking answers to the same question.
 *
 * ⛔ Only providers the SERVER says it can complete are ever offered. An unconfigured one produces a
 * button that fails every single time it is pressed, which reads as a broken site rather than as a
 * missing credential.
 *
 * ⚠ An anchor, never a button with an onClick. OAuth is a full page navigation to the provider and
 * back; a fetch cannot carry it, and the session lands in a cookie the page is not allowed to read.
