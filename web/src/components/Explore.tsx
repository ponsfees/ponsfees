/**
 * The dashboard: every token launched here, split by whether it still trades on its bonding curve.
 *
 * ## ⛔⛔ A LAUNCH APPEARS IN EXACTLY ONE SECTION
 *
 * Graduated tokens are removed from the curve list rather than shown in both. They are different
 * things: one has a curve you can still buy on, the other has a Uniswap V4 pool. A launch appearing
 * twice would also double every count on the page.
 *
 * ## ⚠ WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY
 *
 * No volume, no 24 hour filter, no trending. All of those need trade history, and this chain's
 * public RPC caps `eth_getLogs` at about 2,000 blocks, roughly three minutes. Shipping those
 * controls would mean shipping pills that quietly reorder nothing.
