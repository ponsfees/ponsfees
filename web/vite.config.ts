       page that only ever talks to the real one.

       ⛔⛔ SIGN-IN AND CLAIMING CANNOT BE TESTED AGAINST THE LIVE API, and that is not a limitation
       of the proxy — OAuth redirects back to the origin that started it, and a session cookie set
       by the live site is never sent to `localhost`. So point this at a local server for
       that work:

         API_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:8810 npx vite

       ⚠ `changeOrigin` is FALSE for a local target. Rewriting the Host header to `127.0.0.1` is
       what the live host needs and what a local server does not, and it makes the callback's
       redirect come back to the wrong place. */

           does not serve — /api/me came back empty and the launch form showed no sign-in providers,
           which reads exactly like an unconfigured server. A LOCAL target is the opposite: rewriting
           Host breaks the OAuth callback's own origin. */

    That looks exactly like a broken registry read and is not one; it cost a debugging detour once.
    ➤ To exercise the real thing, build and preview:  npm run build && npx vite preview --port 5241
