/**
 * 🔴🔴 LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY. THIS SIGNS ANYBODY IN AS ANYBODY.
 *
 * It exists so the whole claim flow, the entitlement arithmetic and the UI can be built and tested
 * before the OAuth apps exist — which is the only part of this we cannot supply for ourselves. On a
 * public origin it would let a stranger sign in as any account and take its fees, so the server
 * REFUSES TO ENABLE IT when `PUBLIC_URL` is https. See `server.mjs`.
 *
 * ⚠ Ids are derived from the handle AND the provider, so the same handle is the same account across
 * restarts and `@alice` on X is a different account from `alice` on GitHub. Short-circuiting that
 * would make the stub exercise something the real providers do not do — in particular it would hide
 * the provider-collision bug that `key()` exists to prevent.
