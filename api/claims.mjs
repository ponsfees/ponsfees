/**
 * What a launch owes an X, GitHub or Twitch account, and the voucher that lets them take it.
 *
 * Ported from Pons Charity's `api/claims.mjs`, itself PONSPAD's `server/src/claims.ts`, which has
 * been paying real people since 20 Aug 2026.
 *
 * ## Why a voucher rather than the server sending
 *
 * The blast radius. A wallet that can send can send **everything**, so one leaked key costs every
 * recipient their balance at once. Here the signer can only ever **sign a voucher**: it cannot move
 * money, cannot withdraw, and cannot change where a voucher pays. The recipient submits their own
 * claim and pays their own gas, so a payout is something they do rather than something they wait for.
 *
 * ## ⛔⛔ WHAT IS OWED IS READ OFF THE CHAIN, NEVER OUT OF A DATABASE
 *
 * {@link FeesClaims} ring-fences money per launch AND beneficiary AND asset, so "what is this
 * account owed" is a question the contract already answers. The server's only additions are the two
 * things the contract cannot know: who owns an X account, and which vouchers it has already signed
 * but nobody has spent yet.
