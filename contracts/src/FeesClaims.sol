/**
 * FEES — paying a launch's fees to whoever proves they own the X, GitHub or Twitch account it names.
 *
 * ⚠ Ported unchanged from Pons Charity's `CharityFeeClaims`, itself PONSI's, which has paid real
 * people since 20 Aug 2026. Only the contract name and therefore the EIP-712 domain differ.
 *
 * ## Why a contract rather than the server just sending
 *
 * FEES could pay people from a hot wallet. It does not, because of the blast radius: a wallet that
 * can send can send **everything**, so one leaked key costs every creator their balance at once.
 * Here the server holds a key that can only ever **sign a voucher**. It cannot move money, cannot
 * withdraw, and cannot change where a voucher pays. The creator submits their own claim and pays
 * their own gas, so a payout is something they do rather than something they wait for.
 *
 * ## ⭐⭐ WHAT THIS ADDS OVER THE OBVIOUS DESIGN: money is RING FENCED PER RECIPIENT
 *
 * The straightforward version of this contract holds one pot per asset and lets any valid voucher
 * draw from it. That works right up until something goes wrong, and then it fails in the worst
 * possible way: a voucher signed for too much on token A is paid out of money that belonged to
 * token B, and B's creator discovers it when their own claim bounces. One arithmetic mistake in an
 * off chain entitlement, or one compromised signer, drains everybody.
 *
 * ➤ So attribution lives HERE rather than in a database. Money enters against a named launch AND a
 * named beneficiary, and a voucher can only ever draw what that pair was credited. One creator
 * being paid from another's fees is not prevented by a rule, it is **unrepresentable**.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ The beneficiary matters as much as the launch, because a launch's fees can be SPLIT between
 * several people. If the ledger stopped at the launch, a split would be a promise kept by whatever
 * signed the vouchers, and a mistake would pay one recipient out of their co-recipient's share.
 * Keyed per pair, a 70/30 split is enforced by the same arithmetic that enforces everything else.
 *
 * ⚠ A beneficiary is an opaque `bytes32` and this contract never interprets it. FEES uses
 * `keccak256("x:12345")`, `keccak256("github:678")` or `keccak256("twitch:910")`, which is how Twitch
 * was added without a change here at all.
 *
 * ⭐ It also makes the owner harmless to creators. `withdraw` can only take what is NOT owed:
 * `outstanding` tracks every credited-but-unclaimed unit, and the owner is refused anything below
 * that line. FEES cannot take a creator's fees even if FEES wants to.
 *
 * ## ⚠⚠ WHAT THIS CONTRACT STILL DOES NOT KNOW
 *
 * It does not know what any launch earned, or who owns an X account. FEES computes both and signs
 * accordingly. What is guaranteed here is narrower and still worth having: a voucher is good
 * exactly once, only for the wallet named in it, only until it expires, and **only up to what its
 * own launch has been credited**. So `claimedFor` is publicly checkable against what that launch's
 * fee route ever delivered.
 *
 * ## ⛔⛔ THIS CONTRACT CAN NEVER BE REPLACED ONCE ANYBODY HAS CLAIMED
 *
 * `claimed` resets to zero at a new address while the off chain record of what was earned persists,
 * so a replacement lets every creator claim their whole history a second time. If it must ever
 * change, the old one has to be paused first and the new one seeded with the old `claimed` figures.
